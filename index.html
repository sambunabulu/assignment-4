        <h4>How Many Players</h4>
        <p>The game of Pig is best with two players, but it can work with more people. Just keep in mind that the downtime between turns grows longer with each additional player, which could be challenging for the little ones. </p>
        <h4>How to Play</h4>
        <p>Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945.[1] As with many games of folk origin, Pig is played with many rule variations. Commercial variants of Pig include Pass the Pigs, Pig Dice,[2] and Skunk. Pig is commonly used by mathematics teachers to teach probability concepts.</p>

      <h2>Pig Game</h2>
      <p>Pig is considered a jeopardy game, where you risk everything to see if you can win more. The numbers on the die (except for "1") each represent points that can accumulateâ€”the winner is the first player to reach 100 or more points.<p><br>
